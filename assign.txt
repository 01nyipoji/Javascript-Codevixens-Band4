3.What is the difference between rest and spread operator?

Rest and spread operators look the same (…) but they differ in their uses.

Spread operator is used to spread or expand element in an array into individual elements out of an array. We can use spread operator to copy an array example: 

const food = [‘gote’, ‘pap’,’zobo’];
const copiedFood = […food];
console.log(copiedFood);// [‘gote’, ‘pap’,’zobo’]

,to merge two arrays from end of the first to the beginning of the second example:

const food1 = [‘gote’, ‘pap’,’zobo’];
const food2 = [‘fanta’, ‘kunu’];
const food3 = […food1, …food2];
console.log(food3);// [‘gote’, ‘pap’,’zobo’, ‘fanta’, ‘kunu’]


,to also pass multiple arguments to a function.

Rest operator is usually used to collect the remaining or the rest of the arguments in an array. For example: 

const food = [‘gote’, ‘pap’,’zobo’, ‘fanta’, ‘kunu’];

console.log(food[0]); // ‘gote’
console.log(food[1]; // ‘pap’
console.log(food[...remaining]); // [’zobo’, ‘fanta’, ‘kunu’]
